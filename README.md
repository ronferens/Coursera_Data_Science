## Coursera Data Science Specialization

This repository includes my work in Coursera's [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)

This great specialization was create by [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) and it consists of 10 courses designed to covers the concepts and tools you'll need throughout the entire data science pipeline.

2. _R Programming_
3. _Getting and Cleaning Data_
4. _Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)_
5. _Reproducible Research_
6. _Statistical Inference_
